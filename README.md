Report: Builder Pattern in Java
1.	What is a Builder Pattern?- Builder is a generative design pattern that makes it easier to create complex objects step by step. It is especially useful when a class has many parameters, and some of them are optional
2.	Why Builder?- it is making the code more readable and understandable. Easy to expand, I can add new parameters without changing the old code
3.	Application of Clean Code:
•	Clear names of methods
•	Minimum duplication, ‘Pizza’ class stores only data, and ‘PizzaBuilder’ is responsible for the build
•	The principle of separation of responsibilities has been used
4.	 Conclusion
In this assignment, the Pizza example shows how the Builder pattern works together with Clean Code ideas. This makes the code easier to read, easier to change, and more flexible to use
